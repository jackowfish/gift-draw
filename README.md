# Getting Started with GiftDraw

Welcome to GiftDraw, the convenient web app that brings a modern twist to the traditional "Secret Santa" draw. With GiftDraw, users can easily submit a list of names and emails, and our system will randomly assign each person someone to gift. Let's make gift-giving more exciting and hassle-free!

This project is powered by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick Start

In the GiftDraw directory, you have access to several commands to manage the app:

### `npm start`

- Launches GiftDraw in development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- The page will auto-reload for any edits.
- Console will display lint errors, if any.

### `npm test`

- Initiates the test runner in an interactive watch mode.
- More about testing: [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

- Compiles the app for production into the `build` folder.
- It ensures optimal performance and bundles React in production mode.
- Ready for deployment post-build.

### `npm run eject`

- **Note: Irreversible once executed!**
- Use `eject` to customize build tools and configurations.
- Post-ejection, you control all configurations and dependencies.
